Ship reports with provenance — full run metadata included and copy-ready
=========================================================================

Every report generated by **pytest-html-plus** includes **automatic run metadata**,
so you always know *what* ran, *where*, and *when* — without extra configuration.

Included metadata fields:
- **Report title** (defaults to output filename)
- **Environment** — defaults to NA when not provided.
    ReporterPlus primarily supports the ``--rp-env`` option.
    For compatibility with existing test setups, if your project already defines and uses ``--env`` or ``--environment``, ReporterPlus will automatically pick up and display that value.
    If none of these options are present, the environment field will remain unset.
- **Branch** populated using the ``--git-branch`` and ``--git-commit`` option.
- **Commit SHA** populated using the  ``--git-commit`` option.
- **Generated timestamp**

.. note::
   Metadata is captured automatically — no extra setup required.

One-click copy
--------------
Each metadata section in the HTML report is **copy-ready**:
- **Copy the entire metadata block** in one click

One-click log & error sharing 📋🔥
=================================

Quickly copy traces, stdout/stderr, and error blocks with a single click — no manual selection, no messy copy-paste.

- ✅ Capture full stack traces, logs and screenshots in the report
- ✅ Copy any block (or the whole block) with one click and paste into your bug tracker, chat, or PR comment

Why it helps
------------
- **Instant reproducibility** — paste commit + test path to rerun the exact failing test
- **Faster triage** — share a single HTML file with full execution context
- **Audit-friendly** — every report carries provenance for compliance and traceability
