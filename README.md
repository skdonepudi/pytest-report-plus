### AND MANY MANY MORE

## Target Audience

This plugin is aimed at those who are:

- Tired of writing extra code just to generate reports or capture screenshots

- Manually attaching logs or outputs to test results

- Are frustrated with archiving folders full of assets, CSS, JS, and dashboards just to share test results.

- Don’t want to refactor existing test suites or tag everything with new decorators just to integrate with a reporting tool.

- Prefer simplicity — a zero-config, zero code, lightweight report that still looks clean, useful, and polished.

- Want “just enough” — not bare-bones plain text, not a full dashboard with database setup — just a portable HTML report that STILL supports features like links, screenshots, and markers.


## Comparison with Alternatives
Most existing pytest reporter tools:

Only generate HTML reports from a single run  (by making you write code for creating xmls like pytest-html) OR they generate all the JS and png files that are not the scope of test results and force you to archive it.

Heavy duty with bloated charts and other test management features(when they arent your only test management system either) increasing your archive size.

This plugin aims to fill those gaps by acting as a companion layer on top of the JSON report, focusing on:

🔄 Merge + flakiness intelligence

🔗 Traceability via metadata

🧼 HTML that’s both readable and minimal

🧼 Quickly copy test paths and run in your local
