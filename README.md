## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install pytest-reporter-plus
# or with Poetry
poetry add --dev pytest-reporter-plus
```


## 🧾 Usage
Generate HTML + JSON reports:

```bash
pytest --html-report --json-report
```
You’ll get:

report.html – a clean, styled HTML report

playwright_report.json – structured data for integrations

You can also choose to custom name your output HTML report by mentioning the name of the html report

## 🔁 Flaky Test Detection
If a test is retried multiple times (e.g. due to a --reruns plugin), the report will flag it as FLAKY.

In the HTML report, you’ll see a badge like:

// Add  snapshot here

## 📧 Email Report (Optional)
Send the HTML report via email using --send-email.
